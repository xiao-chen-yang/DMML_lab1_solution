[["index.html", "STATS5099 Data Mining and Machine Learning 1 Welcome to DMML Lab 1", " STATS5099 Data Mining and Machine Learning 1 Welcome to DMML Lab 1 In week 1, we have studied how to use principal component analysis (PCA) to perform dimension reduction. Before implementing PCA, we should always check that the variables are continuous and perform some exploratory analysis. Some useful codes include: str, skim, summary, cor #for numerical summaries plot, pairs #for graphical summaries Next, we perform PCA by using the command princomp. If the variables have been recorded on different scales or they have very different variances, then it is advisable to base the analysis on the sample correlation matrix; in this case, we set the second argument cor to TRUE. Otherwise, covariance matrix is preferred (no need to include the second argument). my.pca &lt;- princomp(my.data, cor=TRUE) #correlation-based PCA my.pca &lt;- princomp(my.data) #covariance-based PCA To determine the number of principal components to be retained, we could use Proportion of Variation, Kaiser's method and Cattell's method. The former two methods require the standard deviation of each principal component, which can be found by using summary(my.pca) or my.pca$sdev. The last method requires a scree plot, which can be produced by using plot(my.pca). Finally, once PCA is performed, we can interpret the principal components by looking at the loadings (my.pca$loadings). Observations in the new PC coordinate system, i.e. scores, are stored in my.pca$scores. A new observation can be projected into the PC space by using predict(my.pca, new.data). "],["exercise-1-tasks-in-lecture-notes.html", "2 Exercise 1: Tasks in lecture notes", " 2 Exercise 1: Tasks in lecture notes In the lecture note, we looked at the wines dataset and explained how to apply PCA to it.

Answer: components What about 95%? Answer: components Hint Look at the row \"Cumulative Proportion\" and find the column whose value is larger than the required proportion of variance explained. Task 3 Some social scientists use Joliffe’s rule, which says that for a PCA run on correlation, only those PCs with variation above 0.6 should be retained. How many PCs should be retained according to this rule? Answer: components Hint Use wine.pca$sdev to find the standard deviation and thus the variance of each PC. Task 4 Looking at the loadings of the PCA, how would you interpret the third principal component? Task 5 Calculate the first component score for the new observation \\((12,4,3,25,100,2,1,0.4,2,4,1,2,600)\\) by hand (using R as a calculator) Answer: The first component score for the new observation is . Hint Step 1. princomp automatically mean-centres each variable. Therefore, you will have to centre the new observation by taking away the centre vector; the centring vector is stored in wine.pca$center. Step 2. Since we used the correlation matrix and so we were working with standardised data, you will have to scale the resulting centred vector by dividing by the scale vector; the scale vector is stored in wine.pca$scale. Step 3. According to the definition, (PC) scores are the inner product of the new observation (after mean-centring and standardisation) and the first principal component loading vector; the 1st PC loadings are stored in wine.pca$loadings[,1]. Calculate the first component score for the new observation \\((12,4,3,25,100,2,1,0.4,2,4,1,2,600)\\) by using the predict command. Answer: The first component score for the new observation is .

Produce two important numerical summaries for deciding on how to run PCA and to tell how successful it is likely to be. Comment on these. Hint Think about which statistics you will need in order to decide whether PCA might useful for this data, and whether to use covariance-based PCA or correlation-based PCA. Run PCA on the appropriate matrix and look at the output. Hint Use the princomp command to implement PCA. Assuming we are most concerned with preserving information, how many coefficients should we retain if we want to have 90% of the original variability kept? Answer: components Assuming we want to use Cattell's method, how many components would we retain? Hint Use plot on your PCA model to produce a scree plot and look for the bend/elbow. Answer: components Assuming we want to use Kaiser's method, how many components would we retain? Answer: components Assuming we have decided to retain 2 components, is there any useful interpretation to be had for these? Hint Look at the loadings by using $loadings.

The standard deviation vary across variables, which suggest that we should use the correlation matrix in PCA (This will be formally checked shortly). The next step of exploratory analysis is to produce some graphical summaries. Here we could use the pairs plot in R. #Look at the pairs plots for the data pairs(employ,pch=20, lower.panel=NULL) Comment: There are a couple of possible outliers. (We'll leave these for the moment and see if they appear again in our scores plot in the end for whether we need to re-run PCA without them included.) The data doesn't appear to fall into groups. There seem to be some linear relationships between pairs of variables but they are not very strong.

For Cattell's method we will need to produce a scree plot. plot(employ.pca) There are some different possibilities here, depending on how you read the graph. Suggesting 2, 4 or 6 components seems reasonable as that's where we see sudden drops/leveling off in variation.
